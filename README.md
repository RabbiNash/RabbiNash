### Hi there Tinashe Here 👋

📝 Sofware Engineer 💙 Data Engineering.

📖 I hold an MSc in Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, i wonder if i should call myself a Mobile Data Engineer.

🌱 I enjoy learning new things, travelling the world and collaborating.

🔭 Recently started working on Teach Me Anything, a data collection App that will enable me to build the next ResNet or YOLO.

✍🏾 I forgot to say i love mathematics and statistics, though i really would appreciate if that love doesn't turn into a career.

💬  If you wanna chat. My twitter is @RabbiNash
