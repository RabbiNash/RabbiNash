📝 I love all things android.

📖 About to complete my Msc In Data Engineering, i wonder if i should call myself an Android Data Engineer.

🌱 I enjoy learning new things, travelling the world and collaborating.

🔭 Recently started working on Teach Me Anything, a data collection App that will enable me to build the next ResNet or YOLO.

✍🏾 I forgot to say i love mathematics and statistics, though i really would appreciate if that love doesn't turn into a career.

💬  If you wanna chat. My twitter is @RabbiNash
